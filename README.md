For the moment we're using the **KANBAN** method, and for development we're using **TDD**

### Kanban

Both To-do, Doing and Code-review have a limits of 3 tasks
We're using five columns: Backlogs - To-do - Doing - Code Review - Done

### TDD

We're making test with jest before code

You can run the test following this command:

```bash
npm run test
pnpm run test
```
